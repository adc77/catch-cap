MODEL RESPONSES:
[1] Let's define the variables:
- Emil's current age = 19 years
- Emil's dad's current age = \(D\)
- Emil's brother's current age = \(B\)

When Emil turns 24, the following conditions hold:
- Emil's age at that time = 24
- Emil's dad's age at that time = \(D + (24 - 19) = D + 5\)
- Emil's brother's age at that time = \(B + (24 - 19) = B + 5\)

According to the problem:
1. Emil will be half the age of his dad:
   \[
   24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \implies 48 = D + 5 \implies D = 43
   \]

2. Emil will be twice as old as his brother:
   \[
   24 = 2(B + 5) \implies 24 = 2B + 10 \implies 2B = 14 \implies B = 7
   \]

Now, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now is:
\[
D + B = 43 + 7 = 50
\]

**Answer:**
\[
\boxed{50}
\]

[2] Let's denote the current ages as follows:
- Emil's age = 19
- Dad's current age = \( D \)
- Brother's current age = \( B \)

According to the problem:
- When Emil turns 24 (in 5 years), he will be half the age of his dad.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

In 5 years:
- Emil's age will be \( 24 \).
- Dad's age will be \( D + 5 \).
- Brother's age will be \( B + 5 \).

From the problem:
1. Emil's age is half of dad's age:
\[
24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \implies D + 5 = 48 \implies D = 43
\]

2. Emil's age is twice his brother's age:
\[
24 = 2 (B + 5) \implies B + 5 = 12 \implies B = 7
\]

Sum of the ages of dad and brother now:
\[
D + B = 43 + 7 = 50
\]

**Answer:**

\[
\boxed{50}
\]

[3] Let's denote:

- Emil's current age = 19 (given)
- Emil's age when he turns 24 = 24
- Dad's age when Emil turns 24 = \( D \)
- Brother's age when Emil turns 24 = \( B \)

According to the problem:

1. When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad:
\[
24 = \frac{D}{2} \implies D = 48
\]

2. When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother:
\[
24 = 2B \implies B = 12
\]

Now, Emil is currently 19, so the time until Emil turns 24 is:
\[
24 - 19 = 5 \text{ years}
\]

That means 5 years ago, the dad and brother were:
- Dad's current age = \( D - 5 = 48 - 5 = 43 \)
- Brother's current age = \( B - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \)

Finally, the sum of the dad's and brother's current ages is:
\[
43 + 7 = 50
\]

**Answer:**

\[
\boxed{50}
\]

[4] Let's define variables:

- Emil's current age = 19 (given)
- Emil's dad's current age = \(D\)
- Emil's brother's current age = \(B\)

When Emil turns 24 (which is in 5 years since he is currently 19):

- Emil's age will be 24
- Dad's age will be \(D + 5\)
- Brother's age will be \(B + 5\)

According to the problem:

1. When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad:
   \[
   24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \implies D + 5 = 48 \implies D = 43
   \]

2. When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother:
   \[
   24 = 2 (B + 5) \implies B + 5 = 12 \implies B = 7
   \]

Now, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is:
\[
D + B = 43 + 7 = 50
\]

**Answer:**
\[
\boxed{50}
\]

WEB SEARCH ANSWER:
Let's define the current ages of Emil, his dad, and his brother:

- Emil is currently 19 years old.
- When Emil turns 24 (in 5 years), the following conditions hold:
  1. Emil's age at that time: 24
  2. Emil will be half the age of his dad at that time.
  3. Emil will be twice as old as his brother at that time.

Let:
- D = current age of his dad
- B = current age of his brother

From the conditions:

1. Emil's age when he turns 24: 24
2. Dad's age at that time: D + 5
3. Brother's age at that time: B + 5

Using the conditions:

**Condition 1:** Emil will be half the age of his dad at that time:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
Multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
Solve for D:
\[ D = 43 \]

**Condition 2:** Emil will be twice as old as his brother at that time:
\[ 24 = 2 (B + 5) \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ 12 = B + 5 \]
Solve for B:
\[ B = 7 \]

**Now, find the sum of their current ages:**
\[ D + B = 43 + 7 = 50 \]

**Answer:** The sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is **50**.

Reasoning: All responses correctly interpret the problem's conditions and perform consistent algebraic calculations to find the current ages of Emil’s dad and brother. They all correctly identify the key step of evaluating ages when Emil turns 24 and derive the values of D and B accordingly. The primary discrepancy is that one response incorrectly derives B as 12 from the second condition, which is a mistake stemming from an error in the algebraic process—it treats the condition as B + 5 = 12 rather than correctly solving 24 = 2(B + 5). Additionally, one response appears to directly calculate B as 12 without considering the context, creating an inconsistency with the setting of the problem. Overall, these responses are not hallucinated or confabulated; they are fairly accurate, though a minor algebraic slip in one response leads to an incorrect intermediate value. The web answer provides a clear, correct step-by-step derivation, aligning with the intended reasoning of the problem.
